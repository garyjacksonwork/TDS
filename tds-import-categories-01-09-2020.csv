Vodka,vodka,"Vodka is a clear distilled alcoholic beverage that originates from Poland and Russia. It’s disputed whether vodka was first produced in Russia or Poland—there’s talk of vodka being produced in Russia in the 9th Century, and in Poland in the 8th Century, but these were both likely crude precursors.  Vodka is composed primarily of water and ethanol, but sometimes with traces of impurities and flavourings. Traditionally it is made by distilling the liquid from cereal grains or potatoes that have been fermented, though some modern brands use fruits or sugar as the base. Vodka is traditionally drunk ""neat"" or ""straight"" (not mixed with water, ice, or other mixer), although it is often served freezer chilled. It is also used in cocktails and mixer drinks, such as the Vodka Martini, Cosmopolitan, Vodka Tonic, Screwdriver, Greyhound, Black or White Russian, Moscow Mule, Bloody Mary, and Bloody Caesar.",,TRUE,TRUE
